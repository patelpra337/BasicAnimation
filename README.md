# BasicAnimation
Animation plays a foundational role in iOS development. Animation supports UI design by allowing smooth transitions between one visual state and another.

Animations shouldn’t draw attention to themselves. Flashy animations work against deferential design. Animations should be small, supportive, and seemingly effortless. Animation serves the interface and should not be the focal point of any GUI.

Because they are so fundamental to the user experience, animation technology exists in many forms and at many levels in the system APIs provided by Apple. Older APIs are more configurable. They provide powerful access to realizing any raw animation you can imagine. Newer APIs are more focused. They offer pre-built hooks to create a uniform user experience across devices.

Today, you’re going to build a basic framework for visualizing animations and then explore both some animation theory and the UIKit technologies that realize that theory.

understand and explain the "rules of animation"
use UIView’s support for simple system animations
use UIView’s animation block methods to animate simple view property changes
use CABasicAnimation to animate layer properties
